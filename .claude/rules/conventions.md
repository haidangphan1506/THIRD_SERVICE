# Rule: Code conventions

See `../.claude/rules/shared-conventions.md` for the cross-service baseline (imports, Zod
validation, secrets, style, messages, Swagger, logging). This file only covers what's specific
or different in third-service.

- **Auth**: routes are guarded globally by `JwtAuthGuard`, `LanguageGuard`, and
  `TokenBucketGuard` (all three registered as `APP_GUARD` in `app.module.ts`, in that order).
  `@Public()` for intentionally open endpoints (`uploads` routes and the `email` test route are
  all `@Public()` today). There is no `admin`/`student`/`auth` feature in this repo — `@Roles`/
  `RolesGuard` exist in `@packages/guards` (shared package copy) but nothing here currently uses
  them.
- **Helpers actually used here** (`@packages/helpers`): `checkUuidValid` (FK validation in
  `NotificationService`), `validateRequiredEnvs` (`database.module.ts`). `generateCode`,
  `hashData`/`compareData`, `buildListWhereClause`, `signAccessToken`/`signRefreshToken` are
  present in the shared `@packages/helpers` copy but unused in this repo's actual feature code —
  don't reach for `buildListWhereClause` on a new list endpoint here; `notification`'s own
  inline `and()`/`eq()`/`ilike()` style is the local convention (see
  `.claude/rules/nestjs-feature-pattern.md`).
- **List response shape**: `{ data, pagination }` (see `NotificationRepository.findAll`) — the
  list key is `data`, not the resource name. This differs from `tutor-service`/`user`'s
  convention; match this repo's existing shape for consistency within it.
- **Swagger tags in `main.ts` are stale** — the `DocumentBuilder` tag list still includes
  `Users`/`Auth`/`Students`/`Curriculum`/`Classes`/`Categories`/`Wallets`/`Transactions`/etc.
  from when this file was copied from another service's `main.ts`. The only tags actually used
  by a `@ApiTags(...)` decorator in this repo are `Notifications`, `Upload`, `Health`, `Redis`
  (and `Emails`, implicitly, if added). Trim stale tags when you're already touching `main.ts`
  for something else — not worth a standalone task on its own.
- **`cloudinary` is an unused dependency** — file uploads go through Cloudflare R2
  (`@aws-sdk/client-s3` against an R2 endpoint), not Cloudinary. Don't add Cloudinary code
  expecting it to be wired up; it isn't.
